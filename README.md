# hebrew-verb-conjugation

notes for myself:

- since js doesn't allow multiple constructors, the verb class is useless tbh
- idk how left to write inputs will work on stuff.like i want inputs to be (ס, ג,ר) for סוגר
- unicode/html for the vowels will be important later: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_and_HTML_for_the_Hebrew_alphabet
